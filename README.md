## Setup guide

#### dependencies
- nvm
- npm

First clone the project from my GitHub repository. After you cloned the project open the project folders with your IDE
of choice or in terminal. Open the **app** folder in the project folder

If you are using windows it's possible that nvm is not installed on your computer,
so you should install it first. <br>

If you are not familiar how to do this follow the guide in the following link:

[Link to node version manager installation guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/nvm-for-windows-how-to-download-and-install-node-version-manager-in-windows-10/)

After that open a terminal in your IDE and run the command bellow.

```angular2html
npm install
```
This will install all the dependencies that you need to run the program.
After that run the code bellow to start the React development server.

```angular2html
npm run dev
```
