# Image-Magnifier

## Project

The goal of this project was to implement a magnifier web application with dynamic zoom level and saturation.

## Installation

I used **vite** for project creation in some cases it needs to be installed before installing the dependencies.

After cloning the project open  the app folder and install the dependencies (run **npm install**)

after installation start the development server with **npm run dev**

the development server will run on the 5173 port
